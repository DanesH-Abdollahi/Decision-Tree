# Decision Tree
Implementation of decision tree using **id3** algorithm in **Matlab** from scratch

- **Part 1** <br />
    Build the decision tree using the training dataset which contains 8 attributes and 2 class label.
    The test results are given in directory `Part_1`.
&nbsp;
- **Part 2** <br />
    Using Reduced Error Pruning Technique for Improving Accuracy of Decision Tree.

    **NOTE** : <br />
    ( 75% of training data is used for training and 25% is used for pruning. )

    All results are given in directory `Part_2`.
&nbsp;
- **Part 3** <br /> 
    This part is as same as part 2 but with different validation method. The validation method is 4-fold cross validation.
